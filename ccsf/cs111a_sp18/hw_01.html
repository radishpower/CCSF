      <h1>Programming Lab 1: Hour of Code Programming Puzzles</h1>
      <h2>Objective: To learn basic programming structures by solving puzzles</h2>
      <p>The "Hour of Code" is done during CS Education Week each December to expose more kids to programming. It has links to some fun puzzles that teach programming concepts. Your assignment is to complete a series of these puzzles. I recommend the <a href="https://studio.code.org/hoc/1">Angry Birds / Plants vs. Zombies series of puzzles</a></p>
      <p>If you're interested to do more, there are many other programming games and tutorials at various levels at <a href="http://csedweek.org/learn">http://csedweek.org/learn</a>. I encourage you to try out as much as you can there and communicate with me what you learn.</p>
      <p>If you are adding this class, your Canvas account will be created a day or two after you've registered for the course. Because of registration issues, etc., late submissions for this assignment will not be penalized.</p>
      <h2>Submitting Your Homework Assignment</h2>
      <p>To show that you did this assignment, please save a screenshot of your solution to the last puzzle in the series you chose and upload to Canvas. If you do not have a Canvas account yet, send an attachment of your screenshot to my e-mail <a href="mailto:grwoo@ccsf.edu">grwoo@ccsf.edu</a> with the subject line <b>CS111A: Practice Problem 1</b>. You can also submit a text file with a list of the steps you used to complete the last puzzle in the series.</p>
      <p>If you find something particularly interesting, please include that in your homework submission. I may ask you to share your insights at the beginning of class for participation points.</p>

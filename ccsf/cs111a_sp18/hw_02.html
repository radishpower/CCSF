Main.java
Simple Hello World Program
*/
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("hello world");
  }
}
      </pre>
      <h2>Submitting Your Homework Assignment</h2>
      <ul>
<li>Your program should be similar to the above program, except yours should have your name, the file's name (as above), and "CS 111A Homework 2" in the comment at the beginning, instead of "Jane Doe".</li>
<li>Turn in your source code and the test run showing how your program worked.</li>
<li>Replace "hello world" with something your pet robot would say.</li>
<li>Turn in your source code and the test run showing how your program worked. This exercise will be graded on the formatting and comment style.</li>
<li>You may use repl.it or any compiler you wish on hills</li>

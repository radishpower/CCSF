     <h1>CS 111A Lecture Notes - Computer Basics  - Chapter 1</h1>
     <h3>Hardware and Software</h3>

     <ul>
       <li><b>Hardware</b> - physical machines
       <li><b>Program</b> - set of instructions to run on those machines
       <li><b>Software</b> - the collection of such programs
     </ul>

     <h3>5 Main Components of Computer Hardware</h3>

     <ol>

     <li><b>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</b> - Fetches and follows instructions, and does simple arithmetic

  calculations. (Following simple instructions given to it.)

     <li><b>Main Memory (RAM)</b> - A silicon-wired card inside the computer box containing huge numbers of

  numbered memory locations (bits organized into bytes).  High speed, low capacity.  Volatile (memory is

  lost when power shuts down).

  <ul>

    <li><b>bit</b> - a binary number; either 0 or 1. Stored electronically with 0 meaning off (no power

    flowing through a circuit) and 1 meaning on (power flowing).

    <li>Because computer memory is based upon this principle of 2 possible states, it's useful to work

    with powers of 2 for computer memory.

    <li><b>byte</b> - 8 bits, giving 2<sup>8</sup> (256) possible values - a more useful unit of measure

    <li><b>memory address</b> - The location of the first byte of memory used for a variable.  Stored

    numerically, often in hexidecimal (base 16) format.

  </ul>

  <li><b>Secondary Memory</b> - Hard drive, flash memory, CD-ROM, etc.  Low speed, high capacity.  Non-

  volatile (nothing lost when power is cut.)

  <li><b>Input Device</b> - Keyboard Mouse, etc. (input stream)

  <li><b>Output Device</b> - Screen, Printer, etc.  (output stream)

</ol>

<h3>Making Software Work</h3>

<ul>

  <li><b>Operating System</b> - Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, etc. intermediary between hardware and software.

  Coordinates operation of tasks, allocates resources.  The OS is a program itself.

  <li><b>High-level language</b> -  Java, C, C++, PHP, JavaScript, Python, etc.  Platform-independent (commands are

  the same for all kinds of computers). Designed to be understandable by people, and usually compiled to work

  on computers.

  <li><b>Low-level language</b> - Very simple computer instructions given one small step at a time.  True

  <b>Machine Language</b> is made up of binary numeric codes for these instructions.  We generally deal

  with its equivalent <b>Assembly Language</b>, which uses short abbreviations for commands, such as "add"

  for an addition calculation, or "sub" for subtraction.  Platform-dependent (commands are different for

  different kinds of computers)

  <li><b>Compiler</b> - Converts a high level language to assembly language, saving it in a new file.  Source

  code to Object code.  A compiler is a program, generally written in a high level language itself. Compilers

  are generally platform-dependent.  They produce assembly language that works only on the machine they are

  running on.

  <li><b>Interpreter - </b> a program which inputs a source code program (such as Perl or PHP) and

  executes it directly, converting each line of code to machine language as it goes.  This is like

  compiling and running a program all in one step.

</ul>

<h3> Java Code</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Java programs are compiled and run in an unsual way - they are both compiled and interpreted:

    <ol>

    <li>The Java source code you write is compiled into <b>Java Byte Code</b>, which is like assembly

    language, but it's machine-independent. (Java Byte Code is the assembly language for an imaginary

    machine called the "Java Virtual Machine".)  The <b>javac</b> program does this for you.  The compiler

    saves the java byte code in a file with the class's name followed by the extension <b>.class</b>

    <li>This Java Byte Code is interpreted and run - it is converted to your specific machine's language as

    it is run.  The <b>java</b> program ("run time environment") does this for you.

    </ol>

  <li> When you're running a program called Prog1, the file you're actually

  executing (through the java interpreter) is Prog1.class, but you type simply "java Prog1" to execute it.

  <li> If you do type "java Prog1.class", the period will be perceived as a directory symbol, meaning the

  java interpreter will attempt to run a file called "class" in a directory called "Prog1".

  <li> This use of the period to specify a directory can also be seen in java code such as this: <br>

  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;import javax.swing.*;</code><br>

  in which we're saying that our program will need to import all the classes in the javax/swing library

  directory. (We'll learn more about this soon)



  <li>Here is a simple Java program:

  <hr>

  <pre>

    /* Craig Persiko

       HelloWorld.java



       Simple Hello World program

    */



    class HelloWorld

    {

      public static void main(String[] args)

      {

        System.out.println("Hello World!");   //Display the string.

      }

    }

  </pre>

  <hr>

  <li>The above program will compile correctly, but if you make one small change, it probably will produce

  a compiler error.

  <li>The formatting of the above program is largely for human readability.  Programs are written for 2

  audiences: they must make sense to both the computer and to other programmers.

  <li>For example, the semicolon is used to mark the end of a line of code.  Hitting return after each

  line is just us to be able to read it better.

  <li>The first line, which begins with "/*" is the beginning of a <B>comment</B>.  Everything from /* to */

  is ignored by the compiler; it's just there for us to read.  Another way to specify a comment is to begin

  it with "//", then the comment ends at the end of the line (like "//Display the string." above)

  <li>All java code must be inside a class definition, and the class must be given a name which matches the

  filename.

  <li> Every stand-alone java program must have a <B>main function</B>, which begins with the header:<br>

  <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>

  <li> <b>Key Words</b> such as "class", "public", "static", and "void" are words that have a special

  meaning in Java. Also called <B>Reserved Words</B>

  <li> <b>Operators</b> are symbols that have special meaning in Java (common examples are: + - * / )

  <li> <b>Punctuation</b> such as the semi-colon ";" the curly-braces "{" and "}" and parentheses "(" and

  ")" is needed in Java to mark boundaries between statements, etc.

  <li> <b>Literals</b> are explicit values in a program, such as the string "Hello, World!"

  <li>Oracle's Java Tutorial website has

  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/index.html">

  some excellent instructions for getting started with Java</a>.  We'll follow their instructions to

  compile and run the above program.

</ul>



<h3>Software Development</h3>

<ul>

  <li><b>Software Development Life Cycle</b> - Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing,

  Maintenance/Evolution, Obsolescence.  Implementation (writing code in Java or other languages) occupies only

  20% of the total development time for a project.

  <li><b>Testing and Debugging</b> - 3 kinds of errors: Syntax/Compile-time, Run-time, and Logic.

  Syntax errors often confuse the compiler, so attack the first error, then try compiling again.



  <li><b>Algorithm</b> - a sequence of precise instructions.  May be conveyed using flowchart, logic diagram,

  pseudo-code, or such. Planning saves time!  Think in terms of what you want, how you can do it, before you

  dive in.

  <li> Here's an example of a pseudo-code algorithm to buy the textbooks for a class, using

  parameters for the course number and section number:

  <p>

  To buy the books for CS 111A Section 001, you would write:<P>

  BuyTextBooks(CourseNumber="CS 111A", SectionNumber="001");<p>

  To buy the books for English 1A Section 581, you would write:<p>

  BuyTextBooks(CourseNumber="ENGL 1A", SectionNumber="581");

  <p>

  Here is the generic algorithm to buy textbooks:

  <p>

  <b>BuyTextBooks(CourseNumber, SectionNumber):</b>

  <ol>

    <li> Go to the college bookstore.

    <li> Pick up a shopping basket.

    <li> Find the section for textbooks.

    <li> Locate the shelf labeled for CourseNumber and SectionNumber.

    <li> <b>Repeat</b> for each required book for this course section:

    <ol>

      <li> Determine the required book's title and author.

      <li> Pick up a copy of the required book and put it in your shopping basket.

    </ol>

    <li> <b>Repeat</b> for each optional book for this course section:

    <ol>

      <li> Determine the optional book's title and author.

      <li> Pick up a copy of the optional book.

      <li> Look at optional book to decide if you want to buy it:

      <li> <b>If</b> you want to buy the optional book:

      <ol>

        <li> Put the optional book in your shopping basket.

      </ol>

      <li> <b>If</b> you do <b>not</b> want to buy the optional book:

      <ol>

        <li> Put the optional book back on the shelf where you found it.

      </ol>

    </ol>

    <li> Go to the cash register.

    <li> Pay for the book(s) in your shopping basket.

    <li> Exit the bookstore with your books.

  </ol>

</ul>

<h3>if-else structures</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An if-statement is a way to have your program make a choice based upon a condition.  It is an
  either-or decision structure, with no repetition.  Here's the format:
    <pre>
      if( <I>&lt;condition&gt;</I> )
      {
        <I>&lt;result 1&gt;;</I>
      }
      else
      {
        <I>&lt;result 2&gt;;</I>
      }
    </pre>
  In the above example, <I>&lt;result 1&gt;</I> represents code which is executed only if the
  <I>&lt;condition&gt;</I> is true.  If it's false, <I>&lt;result 2&gt;</I> is executed instead.  The curly
  braces are only needed for results that contain more than one line of code.
  <li>The else-clause is optional.  So the following as allowed as well:
    <pre>
      if( <I>&lt;condition&gt;</I> )
      {
        <I>&lt;result 1&gt;;</I>
      }
    </pre>
  In the above format, if <I>&lt;condition&gt;</I> is false, <I>&lt;result 1&gt;</I> is not executed, and
  the code continues after the closing curly brace (or after the semi-colon if there are no curly braces).
  <li>With all if and if-else statements, whether or not the condition is true, the code always continues
  after the if structure is finished.
  <li> Notice the placement of semi-colons above.
  <li> Remember that indentation reflects the level, or scope, of a line of code.
  <li> The result/body of an if-statement or else-statement is always indented a bit more than the
  surrounding code.
</ul>


<h3>Relational Operators</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use <b><code>==</code></b> for equality comparison! (assignment operator "=" changes the value on the
  left, instead of checking to see if values are equal)
  <li><b><code>&lt;</code></b> means less than
  <li><b><code>&lt;=</code></b> means less than or equal to
  <li><b><code>&gt;</code></b> means greater than
  <li><b><code>&gt;=</code></b> means greater than or equal to
  <li><b><code>!=</code></b> means not equal

</ul>

<b>In-class exercise #1:</b> Write a program to input the names and ages of 2 people. Then output which name is longer,
and if the ages are the same or not.<p>

<h3>Nested and Multi-Way If-Statements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Like most other structures, if-statements may be nested, meaning one if-statement may be put inside
  another.  Beware of dangling else-statements in such structures.  For example:
  <pre>
    int age = 17;
    if (age &gt;= 18)
      if (age &lt;= 65)
        System.out.println("working age");
      else
        System.out.println("not working age");
  </pre>
  What will be output by the above code?  Else-statements always go with the most recent if-statement in
  their block, so the else applies to situations where age is over 65 only.  No output is produced.  To
  make the else-statement associate with the first if-statement, curly braces must be used:
  <pre>
    int age = 17;
    if (age &gt;= 18)
    {
      if (age &lt;= 65)
        System.out.println("working age");
    }
    else
      System.out.println("not working age");
  </pre>
  Now the text "not working age" will be displayed, but only if age is under 18.  If it's over 65, no
  output is produced.  The indentation is different above for readability, but the curly braces,
  indentation, are what changed the program behavior.
  <p>
  <li>If-statements can also be nested to produce <b>multi-way if-statements</b>.  For example:
  <pre>
    if(age &lt; 13)
      System.out.println("child");
    else
      if(age &lt; 18)
        System.out.println("teenager");
      else
        System.out.println("adult");
  </pre>
  One of the above outputs will always be produced.  For better readability, however, the above code is
  usually written a bit differently:
  <pre>
    if(age &lt; 13)
      System.out.println("child");
    else if(age &lt; 18)
      System.out.println("teenager");
    else
      System.out.println("adult");
  </pre>
  The meaning of the code is exactly the same, but the indentation more clearly shows that one of the 3
  options will always be executed.

  the above interest program, with more if-statements, more interest rates.
  <li> <b>In-class exercise #2:</b> change the program from last class (NamesAndAges.java above) to show who is younger
  or older as well, and to output if the names are the same length.

</ul>


<h3>Logical Operators</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span style='font-size:14pt; font-family:"Courier New"'>&amp;&amp;</span> means logical AND.  This
  "and sign" is usually called the "ampersand".  Two of them together mean logical intersection (both sides
  must be true).

  <li><span style='font-size:14pt; font-family:"Courier New"'>||</span> means logical OR.  This vertical
  line is called the "pipe".  On the keyboard it usually has a break in the middle, and it's the shifted
  back-slash (Shift + \). Two of them together mean logical union (either side must be true).

  <li><span style='font-size:14pt; font-family:"Courier New"'>!</span> means logical NOT.  This exclamation
  point means the opposite of what follows it (false becomes true and vice versa).
  <li>No strings of inequalities are allowed, e.g. Don't write:<br>
  <code>if (x &lt; y &lt; z)</code><br> instead, write:<br>
  <code>if (x &lt; y &amp;&amp; y &lt; z)</code><br>
  Comparison operators are strictly binary, and they produce a boolean result.
  <li>You also cannot write something like:<br>
  <code>if(age &gt;= 18 &amp;&amp; &lt;= 65)</code><br> instead write: <br>
  <code>if(age &gt;= 18 &amp;&amp; age &lt;= 65)</code><br> Logical operators must work on boolean values.
  <li> Don't use <b><code>!&lt</code></b> because it's not valid. The way to write that is
  <b><code>&gt;=</code></b>
  <li> <b>Operator Precidence (Order of Operations)</b> - The Not operator (!) has the highest precidence, then all mathematical operators are processed. Next come the comparison operators (<, >, ==), and logical And (&&) and finally, logical Or (||).  The detailed 
  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html"> operator precidence for all Java operators can be found here.</a>


  <li> <b>Short-circuit evaluation</b> - Sometimes, the result of an AND or OR expression can be
  determined without evaluating both sides of the AND or OR.  This can save time, and it can also alter
  program behavior.  For example:
  <pre>
    int num = 5, den = 0;
    if (den != 0 && num/den &gt; 1)
      System.out.println(" num is greater than den ");
    else
      System.out.println(" den is 0 or it's greater than num");
  </pre>
  The above code will generate a run-time error (division by zero) if the right-side of the AND expression
  is evaluated.  Fortunately, the left-side will evaluate to false, making the whole expression false no
  matter what the right expression produces.  So the program will never perform the division, and no
  run-time error will result.
</ul>

<h3>Boolean Expressions and Variables</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Boolean</b> - a term named after mathemetician George Boole, who formulated rules for
  mathematical logic.  Refers to true/false values and logic corresponding to them.
  <li><b>boolean</b> - a datatype representing a boolean value.  Can have literal values true or false.
  <li>Boolean expressions are most often used as the condition for a loop or if-statement.  Such a
  condition is always evaluated for truth or falsehood, and if it's true, the condition is satisfied.
  <li>You may store the result of a Boolean expression in a Boolean variable, and you may use that
  variable as the condition for an if-statement or loop. E.g.:
  <pre>
    int x = 5;
    boolean b = x &lt; 10;  // store true in b if x is less than 10, false otherwise
    if (b)   // means "if (b == true)"
      System.out.println("x is less than 10");  // this output will be displayed
  </pre>
  <li> The following program illustrates all of the above concepts:
  <a href="BooleanApp.java.html">BooleanApp.java</a>
  <li> <b>In-class exercise #3:</b> Modify the Names And Ages Program from the previous class exercise, so it outputs if
  one or both people are between 18 and 65 years old. You must use a logical and (&&) or or (||). Try using a
  boolean variable as well. Here is some sample output: <pre>
    -bash-3.2$ java NamesAndAgesPart3
    Please enter first person's name:
    Craig
    Please enter first person's age:
    37
    Please enter second person's name:
    Serafina
    Please enter second person's age:
    7
    Craig is between 18 and 65, but Serafina is not.
    -bash-3.2$ java NamesAndAgesPart3
    Please enter first person's name:
    Tobias
    Please enter first person's age:
    5
    Please enter second person's name:
    Serafina
    Please enter second person's age:
    7
    Neither person is between 18 and 65.
    -bash-3.2$ java NamesAndAgesPart3
    Please enter first person's name:
    Geoff
    Please enter first person's age:
    37
    Please enter second person's name:
    Craig
    Please enter second person's age:
    37
    Both people are between 18 and 65
    -bash-3.2$
</pre>

</ul>

<h3>Switch Statements</h3>
<ul>
  <li> A switch statement is another alternative to a multi-way if-statement.  It cannot express ranges of
  values such as (x &lt; 0), but it is fast and clear when an expression is being checked for one of
  several possible values which are known at compile-time (a variable compared to one or more int or char
  literals or constants).
  <li> In addition, the switch statement can only be used with integer, character, and String datatypes (int, char,
  byte, short, long, and String).
  <li> Here is an example of a switch statement:
  <pre>
    switch(age)
    {
      case 16:                           // if age == 16
        System.out.println("you can now drive");
        break;
      case 18:                           // if age == 18
        System.out.println("you can now vote");
        break;
      case 21:                           // if age == 21
        System.out.println("you can now drink");
        break;
      default:           // if none of the above match age
        System.out.println("there is nothing special about your age");
    }
  </pre>
  <li> The <b>default</b> section is optional
  <li> The keyword <b>break</b> is needed to exit the switch statement. Without it, the next case's code
  would be executed as well.
  <li> Example: <a href="SwitchGrades.java.html">SwitchGrades.java</a> demonstrates switch statements

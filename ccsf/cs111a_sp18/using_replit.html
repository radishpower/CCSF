<p><a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a> is a cloud computing environment which supports a number of compilers including Java. As an alternative to testing out your programs on Hills, you may also use http://repl.it to complete your homework assignments.</p>
<h2>Java Link</h2>
<p>For Java, you can go directly to the repl Java coding environment <a href="https://repl.it/languages/java">here</a>. You will see a link which offers you to copy and paste a few example programs. For example, you can copy and paste the following:</p>
<pre>class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("hello world");
  }
}
</pre>
<p>into the environment and expect to see the output in the terminal on the right. Make sure that you are choosing the "java" language in the URL.</p>

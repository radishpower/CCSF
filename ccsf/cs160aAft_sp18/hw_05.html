      <h1>In-Class Lab 5: Let's Build a Playground</h1>
      <h2>Chapters 4 in Shotts (Pages 34 - 41) | <a href="http://ccsf.avocadocheesecake.com/cs160aAft_sp18/LetsBuildPlayground.pdf">Book Excerpt</a></h2>

      <p>We have learned quite a bit about how file systems work and how we can manipulate and navigate them.</p>

      <p>Take the time to read over how Shotts presents this material and practice submitting a clean script session which communicates what you have created.</p>

      <h2>Submitting Your Homework Assignment</h2>
      <p>Transfer your output script session as an attachment on Canvas</p>
      <p>If you find something particularly interesting, please include that in your homework submission as a comment. I may ask you to share your insights at the beginning of class for participation points.</p>
      <p>Feel free to ask questions in your comments that I may not have had the chance to go over in class.</p> 
      <p>Don't worry about completion in this assignment, I will be looking for a readable script file and your method of communication your work through a script session.</p>

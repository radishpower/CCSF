      <h5>Environment Variables</h5>

      <p>Your "Home" directory can be seen in a few ways:</p>

      <pre>[me@linuxbox ~]$ echo $HOME</pre>
      <pre>/home/me</pre>

      <p>The HOME variable on command line stores the absolute pathname of your home directory.</p>

      <p>Table 11-1 shows some of the other interesting envrionment variables available in most Linux distributions.
      Some noteable ones are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>DISPLAY | Name of your display if you are running a graphical environment. Usually this is ":0", meaning the first display generated by the X server</p>
        <li><p>EDITOR | Name of the program to be used for text editing</p>
        <li><p>SHELL | Name of your home directory</p>
        <li><p>PATH | Colon-separated list of directories searched when you enter the name of an executable program</p>
        <li><p>PS1 | Prompt String 1. This defines the contents of the shell prompt and can be extensively customized</p>
        <li><p>TERM | Name of your terminal type. Unix-like systems support many protocols; this variable sets the protocol to be used with your terminal emulator</p>
      </ul>

      <h5>Text Editors</h5>

      <p>Text editors are invoked on the command line. For example, if we want to use <b>gedit</b>, we can do:</p>

      <pre>[me@linuxbox ~]$ gedit some_file</pre>

      <p>Graphic text editors are pretty self-explanatory but there are a number of text-based editors available in the Linux environment.</p>

      <p>One file you can practice editing is the .bashrc file</p>
      <p>Always make sure to create a backup</p>

      <p>You can see many of the available text editors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors">here</a></p>

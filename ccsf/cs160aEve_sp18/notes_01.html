     <h1>CS 160A - What is the Shell? - Navigating File Structures</h1>

     <h2>Computer Basics</h2>

     <h3>Hardware and Software</h3>

     <ul>
       <li><b>Hardware</b> - physical machines
       <li><b>Program</b> - set of instructions to run on those machines
       <li><b>Software</b> - the collection of such programs
     </ul>

<h3>5 Main Components of Computer Hardware</h3>

     <ol>

     <li><b>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</b> - Fetches and follows instructions, and does simple arithmetic

  calculations. (Following simple instructions given to it.)

     <li><b>Main Memory (RAM)</b> - A silicon-wired card inside the computer box containing huge numbers of

  numbered memory locations (bits organized into bytes).  High speed, low capacity.  Volatile (memory is

  lost when power shuts down).

  <ul>

    <li><b>bit</b> - a binary number; either 0 or 1. Stored electronically with 0 meaning off (no power

    flowing through a circuit) and 1 meaning on (power flowing).

    <li>Because computer memory is based upon this principle of 2 possible states, it's useful to work

    with powers of 2 for computer memory.

    <li><b>byte</b> - 8 bits, giving 2<sup>8</sup> (256) possible values - a more useful unit of measure

    <li><b>memory address</b> - The location of the first byte of memory used for a variable.  Stored

    numerically, often in hexidecimal (base 16) format.

  </ul>

<li><b>Secondary Memory</b> - Hard drive, flash memory, CD-ROM, etc.  Low speed, high capacity.  Non-

  volatile (nothing lost when power is cut.)

  <li><b>Input Device</b> - Keyboard Mouse, etc. (input stream)

  <li><b>Output Device</b> - Screen, Printer, etc.  (output stream)

</ol>

<h3>Making Software Work</h3>

<ul>

  <li><b>Operating System</b> - Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, etc. intermediary between hardware and software.

  Coordinates operation of tasks, allocates resources.  The OS is a program itself.

  <li><b>High-level language</b> -  Java, C, C++, PHP, JavaScript, Python, etc.  Platform-independent (commands are

  the same for all kinds of computers). Designed to be understandable by people, and usually compiled to work

  on computers.

  <li><b>Low-level language</b> - Very simple computer instructions given one small step at a time.  True

  <b>Machine Language</b> is made up of binary numeric codes for these instructions.  We generally deal

  with its equivalent <b>Assembly Language</b>, which uses short abbreviations for commands, such as "add"

  for an addition calculation, or "sub" for subtraction.  Platform-dependent (commands are different for

  different kinds of computers)

  <li><b>Compiler</b> - Converts a high level language to assembly language, saving it in a new file.  Source

  code to Object code.  A compiler is a program, generally written in a high level language itself. Compilers

  are generally platform-dependent.  They produce assembly language that works only on the machine they are

  running on.

  <li><b>Interpreter - </b> a program which inputs a source code program (such as Perl or PHP) and

  executes it directly, converting each line of code to machine language as it goes.  This is like

  compiling and running a program all in one step.

</ul>

     <h2>GUI (Graphical User Interface) and CLI (Command Line Interface)</h2>

     <ul>
       <li>"Graphical User Interfaces make easy tasks easy, while command line interfaces make difficult tasks posssible"
       <li>"Taking back control of your computer"
       <li>"Linux" refers to the kernel and all the other free and open source software found in the typical Linux distribution; that is, the entire Linux ecosystem, not just the GNU components.
     </ul>

     <h2>The Shell</h2>

     <p>Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called <b>bash</b>. The name <b>bash</b> is an acronym for "Bourne Again Shell", a reference to the fact <b>bash</b> is an enhanced replacement for <b>sh</b>, the original Unix shell program written by Steve Bourne.</p>

     <p>Within a graphical user interface, we require a <em>terminal emulator</em> to interact with the shell. For example:</p>

     <ul>
       <li>KDE uses konsole
       <li>GNOME uses gnome-terminal
     </ul>

     <p>The use of Mice, Focus, Ctrl-c and Ctrl-v depend on your terminal emulator.</p>

    <h2>Simple Commands to Try</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>date
      <li>cal
      <li>df
      <li>free
      <li>exit
    </ul>

    <h3>In-Class Exercise #1: Test out some of these commands. With the help of the course text and the command <b>man</b>, see if you can figure out what each of these commands do</h3>

    <h2>Navigation</h2>

    <p>Like Windows, a Unix-like operating system such as Linux organizes its
    files in what is called a hierarchical directory structure. This means that
    they are organized in a tree-like pattern of directories (sometimes called
    folders in other systems), which may contain files and other directories.
    The first directory in the file system is called the root directory.  The
    root directory contains files and subdirectories, which contain more files
    and subdirectories and so on and so on.</p>

    <p>Useful tools for navigating file structures:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>pwd - Print name of current working directory
      <li>cd - Change directory
      <li>ls - List directory contents
      <li>file - Determine file type
      <li>less - View file contents
    </ul>

    <p>Absolute Pathnames: An absolute pathname begins with the root directory
    and follows the tree branch by branch until the path to the desired
    directory or file is completed.</p>

    <p>Relative Pathnames: Where an absolute pathname starts from the root
    directory and leads to its destination, a relative pathname starts from the
    working directory</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"." (dot) refers to working directory
      <li>".." (dot dot) refers to parent directory
    </ul>
